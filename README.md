# High-dimensional-Data-visualization-techniques-using-python
In this project i implemented Scatterplot Matrix and Parallel coordinate plots (PCP) in python,used these two high-dimensional data visualization techniques to analyze the data by solving three tasks: Outlier Detection, Correlation Analysis and Cluster analysis,sampled the data to reduce the number of the data points for a better visualization.
Finally i employed  Dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the number of dimensions in the dataset
